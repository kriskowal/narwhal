The descriptor contains methods like when(rejected), get(name),\nput(name, value), post(name, args), delete(name), and valueOf(), which all\nreturn either a value, a promise for a value, or a rejection.  The fallback\naccepts the operation name, a resolver, and any further arguments that would\nhave been forwarded to the appropriate method above had a method been\nprovided with the proper name.  The API makes no guarantees about the nature\nof the returned object, apart from that it is usable whereever promises are\nbought and sold.",
